        <p id="Info">The Tenenerife Disaster is often referred as the worst plane disaster in history in which 583 people lost their lives on March 27, 1977.
             it occured at Los Rodeos Airport (currently known as <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1qaiuv7eNRPfeR2P9">Tenerife Noth Airport</a>) in the Spanish island of Tenerife. It involved
            two jumbo jets operated by KLM and the other by Pan Am. A combination of unfortunate circumstance the two planes collided in the runway.
             This accident led to many changes in the future.</p>
            <br>
        <h2 id="ReasonH">Reason for Crash</h2>
        <p id="Reason">The Tenerife airport disaster happened as a result of a chain of events at Los Rodeos Airport. On that day the airport was operating at maximum capacity due to a bomb threat
             at Gran Canaria that had forced multiple fligths to Los Rodeos Airport. Thick fog decreased the visibility that caused both KLM Boing 747 and Pan Am Boing 747-121 to not see each 
             other while using the same runway. The KLM plane was istructed by tower control to taxi down the runway and then make a 180 degree turn to get into takeoff position. While that 
             was happening the Pan Am flight was instructed by tower control to taxi down the runway and take the third exit to their left and use the parallel taxi. The Pan Am plane missed
             the exit while KLM flight started take-off when it wasnt supposed to due to a communication error. Both planes collided close to exit 4. The Pan Am flight tried to make a sharp turn 
             to the left towards the grass in an attempt to avoid the collision. By the time the KLM pilots saw the Pan Am plane they werent able to stop as they were already moving too fast,
              instead they prematurely rotated the aircraft nose upward and attempted to lift up.

        <h2 id="ChangesH">Changes Implemented after</h2>
        <p id="Changes">In the aftermath and the investigation of the Tenerise Airport Disaster, many changes were implemented in the aviation industry to improve safety and avoid this type of accidents from happening again.
            These changes include the use of standardized phraseology for air traffic control to decrease misunderstandings, increased training for pilots and traffic control, improvements in cockpit resource
             management to increase teamwork and effective communications among flight crews, advancements in navigation and warning systems, increased protocols for adverse weather conditions.
