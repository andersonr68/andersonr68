        <p id="Info">Japan Airlines Flight 123 remains one of the deadliest aviation disasters. On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR crashed into Mount Osutaka in Gunma Prefecture resulting in 520 casualties.
            It impacted in a densely populated region after a mid-flight failure shortly after takeoff

        <h2 id="ReasonH">Reason for Crash</h2>
        <p id="Reason">The crash is attributed to a structural failure in the aircraft. A critical component of the plane which is the rear pressure bulkhead had been inadequately repaired following a previous incident.
            This improper repair weakened the bulkhead, and overtime led to a sudden and catastrophic decompression at a high altitude. This loss of cabin pressure placed high amounts of stress in the already 
            weakened structure, this caused a rupture that tore a gaping hole in the fuselage. This rupture resulted in the rapid loss of cabin pressure and severed critical hydraulic lines, this rendered the 
            plane's flight controls almost impossible to control. As a result of this the aircraft became extremely chanllening to control, the crew desperately struggled to keep the plane airborne. The aircraft 
            collided with Mount Osutaka killing 520 people on board. This marks the importance of rigorous maintenance and what can happen if there isnt maintenance

        <h2 id="ChangesH">Changes Implemented after</h2>
        <p id="Changes">This incident had a significant impact in the aviation industry. It prompted a reevaluation of maintenance and inspection procedures. This tragedy also focused the importance of proper repairs 
            and maintenance. It also it showed the critical need for comprehensive training programs for flight crews and maintenance personnel to handle emergency situations affectively. Overall safety measures and 
            procedures have been enhanced to prevent a similar event.
